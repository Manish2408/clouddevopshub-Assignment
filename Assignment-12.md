Navigate to Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic).
Click on Generate new token.
Select the scopes/permissions you want (at least repo for full control of private repositories).

2. Update Git to Use the Token:
When you push your code, instead of using your password, youâ€™ll use the Personal Access Token as the password.
